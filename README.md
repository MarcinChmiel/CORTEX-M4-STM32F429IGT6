Hello everyone :)

I'd like to introduce to You how to program Cortex M4: STM32F429IGT6 microprocessor.
I won't use any functions here, I will work with Reference Manual & Datasheet using microprocessor registers.
All examples in this repository will be written using embedded C language.

I'll focus on how-to-set STM32F429IGT6 features like
- IO configuration
- Timers
- ADC
- USART
- RNG
- I2C
- SPI
and so on...
